% Create an script to prove that the obtained results from the system in
% the endemic equilibium case are the same as the obtained manually. The
% system equations depende of variables which values are unknown, for the
% simulation random values will be asigned to these variables.

%% Constants definition
la = rand(); rho = rand(); be = rand(); bs = rand(); ba = rand();
p2 = rand();  p1 = rand(); mu = rand(); sig = rand(); gamma = rand();
alpha = rand(); 

%% Manual solution
